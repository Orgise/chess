# Chess Pursuit

![Chess Pursuit portrait](./screens/game-portrait.png "Chess Pursuit")

The idea of this game is to turn the chess game upside down, making it an action game instead of a strategy game.

## Manual
> Use arrow keys or mouse to move around.

> You can use the 'return' key to pause the game (but that's cheating !).

> You don't need to really know the [Chess rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess#Movement) to play, but that could definitely help!
