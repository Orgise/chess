# Compilation of useful and curious projects

## About the project
In this project I gather some geek notes that I find interesting to learn, some useful scripts and web applications of all kinds. Most of the content is in Spanish.

On the Internet we are shown a lot of advertisements for a website that does not need any. That is why I bring you multiple programs that will be useful to you, as well as some video games and awesome websites that will surprise your friends without any ads or trackers involved.

You can review the source code of each program, as well as request new pull requests.

The project has been migrated to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/Dalde/pages).
