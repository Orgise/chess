# Compilation of useful and curious projects

## About the project
In this project I have compiled several projects that I have found on the Internet, mainly in [Codepen](https://codepen.io).

On the Internet we are shown a lot of advertisements for a website that does not need any. That is why I bring you multiple programs that will be useful to you, as well as some video games and programs that will surprise your friends without any ads or trackers involved.

You can review the source code of each program, as well as request new pull requests.
